Statistical forecasting project on an Australian retail turnover time series dataset as part of the Monash University coursework unit ETC3550.

Key tasks performed in this project include:

- Performed data visualisation to inspect the statistical features of the raw dataset.

- Employed appropriate data transformation and decomposition.

- Fitted appropriate predictive time series models, including the ETS (Exponential Smoothing) model and the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model.

- Evaluated the forecast accuracy measures of the fitted models by producing in-sample point forecasts.

- Produced out-of-sample point and interval forecasts of the Australian Retail Turnover (Tasmanian Takeaway Food Turnover) data.
