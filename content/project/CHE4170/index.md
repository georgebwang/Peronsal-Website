Chemical Engineering final year design project co-authored with Sam Landby, Emma Selwood, Brintha Vijaya Kumar, Ying Fei Low and Rakha Octavano, supervised by Prof.Mark Banaszak Holl from the Department of Chemical Engineering, Monash University. 

The project involved a comprehensive conceptual design project in a team of six people, in which detailed engineering design was carried out to propose a dairy processing plant in Tasmania, Australia. 

Key tasks performed include:

- Conducted market and geographical location research to determine the product portfolio of the plant, utilising as much raw milk processing capacity as possible while minimising production waste to promote process sustainability.

- Carried out process technology research and selection to determine the most economical and efficient process route, and consequently drafted the process flow diagrams (PFDs) for the whole plant.

- Performed mass and energy balances to quantify the amount of products yielded, followed by process optimisation where possible, making use of water and heat integration strategies.

- Performed detailed economical analysis to investigate the economic viability of the proposed plant by establishing a projected cash flow table and performing sensitivity analysis against a few potential risk factors. 

- Discussed the safety and environmental aspects of the plant, which involved conducting a hazard & operability (HAZOP) session with another design team, drafting an environmental impact assessment (EIA) table, a hazard identification (HAZID) table to ensure inherent process safety and environmental friendliness.

- Carried out an independent detailed calculation and design of a specific piece of key equipment in the process (selected item is Shell & Tube Heat Exchanger) in accordance with the Australian design standards (e.g. AS1210, TEMA); drafted a detailed mechanical drawing piece, a process safety bow-tie diagram and a piping & instrumentation diagram (P&ID) for the detailed design item using computer-aided design (CAD) software - Microsoft Visio.
