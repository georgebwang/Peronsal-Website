Portfolio research/construction project as part of the Monash University coursework unit ETC3460.

Key tasks performed in this project include:

- Performed quantitative analysis on ASX200 stocks and computed statistical measures (moments, CAPM alpha & beta, Sharpe Ratio) for each stock.

- Chose the best performed stocks based off quantitative analysis on one-year ex-post performance to construct a portfolio.

- Computed optimal portfolio weighting allocations through the construction of an efficient frontier.

- Documented portfolio returns and performed data visualisation to inspect the time series properties.

- Fitted financial time series modelling to the sampled portfolio returns data (CAPM, ARMA and GARCH models).

- Produced out-of-sample point and interval forecasts of the portfolio return using the best fitted model - CAPM-EGARCH(1,1).

The project was ranked the top 7 in the cohort (ETC3460 S1 2020) and was awarded full marks.
