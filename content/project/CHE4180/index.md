Chemical Engineering final year research project co-authored with Mark Zhao and supervised by Dr.Simon Corrie from the Department of Chemical Engineering, Monash University. 

The project involved implementing automatic image segmentation on laboratory ultrasound images using machine learning mechanisms via the Trainable Weka Segmentation module in the open-source image analysis software `ImageJ`, and consequently evaluating its classification accuracy making use of performance metrics via the R programming language. 

Key tasks performed in this research project include:

- Evaluated the auto-segmentation/classification performance of the Machine Learning module Trainable Weka Segmentation in ImageJ on ultrasound images employing binary classification performance metrics and ROC(Receiver Operating Characteristics) analysis (in R).

- Investigated the performance of different Machine Learning models - Random Forest and Naive Bayesian.

- Proposed a generalised model training approach to the ultrasound image data and evaluated the viability of this approach.
