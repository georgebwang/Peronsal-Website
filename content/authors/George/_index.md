`Welcome:smiley:!` I'm George and I'm currently a graduate research student in the Department of Banking and Finance, Monash University. I completed my Bachelor's double degrees in Chemical Engineering (Honours) and Commerce (major in Finance and minor in Econometrics) at Monash. I'm now undertaking the new research-oriented Master of Commerce (MCom) program with full graduate research scholarship. My proposed research direction broadly lies in the field of empirical asset pricing.

Please feel free to take a *random walk* on my website as you wish! :smirk:
